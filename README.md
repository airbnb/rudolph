# Rudolph
Rudolph is the control server counterpart of [Santa](https://github.com/google/santa), and is used to rapidly deploy configurations to Santa agents.

Rudolph is built in Amazon Web Services, and utilizes exclusively serverless components to reduce operational burden. It is designed to be fast, easy-to-use, low-maintenance, and cost-conscious.

## Who is Rudolph For?
Rudolph is built for teams interested in deploying [Santa](https://github.com/google/santa) to implement Binary Authorization
on MacOS environments. In particular, it is designed to support Santa in **Lockdown Mode**.

Addtionally, Rudolph uses Amazon Web Services and is ideal for teams that are too small to stand up or maintain more
sophisticated environments.

* Easy deployment: Set up the entire stack in 20 minutes. Tear it down in 1 minute
* (Almost) Zero maintaintence
* Proven scalability & cost-efficiency
* Scales up and down automatically
* High performance; Rudolph is _designed_ to support 60-second sync intervals on Santa sensors, for real-time unblocking
