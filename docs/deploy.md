# Deployment

## Getting Ready
You will only need to do this stuff once. Once you're setup

## Golang
You will need golang version 1.15+ installed. Go get it from [the golang website](https://golang.org/dl/).

## Amazon Web Services
You will need an AWS account handy, as well as an IAM role with sufficient privileges.

## Terraform
You will need Terraform v0.14+ installed. We recommend using [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv).

## Registered Domain
You will need a registered DNS domain name for Rudolph's API server.

Purchasing a domain is very easy, simply use use AWS's Route 53 service to register a new domain. The exact URL
is rarely seen by end users of Santa-Rudolph, so we advise picking any random cheap one to start things up quickly.


# Initial Setup
First, you will need to [set up a new environment](deployments/environments/example/README.md).

## Terraform Files
Follow the instructions in the provided link and create all necessary Terraform configuration files. You will
end up creating:

* A new directory under `deployments/environments`
* A `main.tf` symlink
* A `variables.tf` symlink
* A `versions.tf` file
* A `_backend.tf` file
* A `config.auto.tfvars.json` file

## EXPORT your ENV
When working with a specific deployment environment, always make sure your `ENV` environment variable is set
properly.

For example, to direct commands at the `deployments/environment/example` environment, you would use:
```
export ENV=example
```

## Install Dependencies
Download and install all golang dependencies with:

```
make deps
```

## Build and Deploy
You can deploy your entire application now. Do not forget to authenticate with aws-cli.

```
make deploy
```

## Test it Out
Make an HTTP POST request to your new deployment. The request should hit a URL that looks something like:

```
POST /preflight/AAAAAAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD-EEEEEEEEEEEE
Host: {{PREFIX}}-rudolph.{YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME}
content-type:application/json
accept:*/*
{
  "serial_num": "1234"
}
```
